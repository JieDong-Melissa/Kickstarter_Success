# Predicting Kickstarter Crowdfunding Success: Data-Driven Investment Strategies 
![image](https://github.com/JieDong-Melissa/Kickstarter_Success/blob/main/images/kickstarter_image.jpeg)
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), a global crowdfunding platform launched on April 28, 2009, supports funding for creative projects across various categories such as films, games, music, art, design, and technology. Based in Brooklyn, New York, it operates on an all-or-nothing model, charging backers only if the funding goal is reached. Successful projects offer backers unique rewards.


This dataset includes information on 20,632 Kickstarter campaigns up to February 1, 2017. It contains 68 features detailing various aspects of each campaign, such as 
- campaign ID, 
- project category, 
- funding goal: amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project,
- blurb: the short description displayed under the name of your project and on the browse page,
- pledged: amount of money that a project has raised,
- backers: people that have supported it at the point of the API pull,
- state: successful, failed, cancelled, live or suspended,
- subcategory, 
- goal amount, 
- pledged amount, 
- campaign state, 
- launch date, 
- end date, and other relevant metrics. 

These features provide insights into the performance and characteristics of Kickstarter campaigns, which can be useful for analyzing trends and identifying factors that contribute to campaign success

Then our goal will be to evaluate and explore multiple supervised machine learning models, to predict if a project funding will be successful or failed before it is launched. 

Important attributes are described below:

Project: a finite work with a clear goal that you’d like to bring to life (aka campaign)

To attain a deeper understanding of our data and to have more attributes to explore, we also created the following features out of the data for our analysis:


in this project, we can find out :

- what is the most common category of kickstarter projects.
- what is the average amount of pledged(USD), goal and backers.
- what is the accuracy score of the prediction model.
- what is the most important factor in having successful project.

i will use the must-have python packages for Data Science and Finance:
- NumPy : Allowing us to work with multidimensional arrays, and a fast numeric array computations
- Pandas : Allowing us to organize data in a tabular form, and quickly loading remote data or a .csv file.
- Sklearn : Machine Learning in Python, Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- Matplotlib : is a Python 2D plotting library.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
